# RainMLProject

The aim of this project is to build and identify the best binary classification model predicting rainfall in Australia using five common algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost). The dataset used in this project describes variables such as temperature, wind and humidity with labels indicating whether it rained that day or the day after. 

The 'final.ipynb' notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering and finally, the modelling. The 'data' folder contains the dataset 'weatherAUS.csv'. The file 'rainMLproject.pdf' summarises this project and elaborates on the potential business impact of an accurate rain prediction model. There are plans for hyperparameter optimization in order to improve the accuracy of the models further.
